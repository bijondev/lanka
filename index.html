<p>Help Sri Lanka is Sri Lanka’s largest people's organisation. Over the last 50 years we have become a network of over 15,000 villages. Today we are engaged in relief efforts in the war-torn north as well as ongoing development projects.</p>
<p>Help Sri Lanka's organization includes 345 divisional units, 34 district offices; 10 specialist Development Education Institutes; over 100,000 youth mobilised for peace building under Shantisena; the country’s largest micro-credit organization with a cumulative loan portfolio of over US$1million (through SEEDS, Help Sri Lanka Economic Enterprise Development Services); a major welfare service organisation serving over 1,000 orphaned and destitute children, underage mothers and elders (Help Sri Lanka Suwa Setha); and 4,335 pre-schools serving over 98,000 children.</p>

<p>Help Sri Lanka's total budget exceeds USD 5 million with 1,500 full-time employees. When combined with numerous volunteer workers, this yields a full time equivalent of approximately 200,000, which places Help Sri Lanka on a par with the entire plantation sector in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>Help Sri Lanka (formally knowns as Lanka Jatika Help Sri Lanka Shramadana Sangamaya) is an organisation developed around a set of coherent philosophical tenets drawn from Buddhism and Gandhian thought; it has been operational for almost 50 years. It has been described as an international role model by international bodies. Its founder and charismatic leader, Dr A.T. Ariyaratne, whose visionary contributions have been recognised in multiple countries, continues to provide ideological and inspirational leadership to the organisation while the day-to-day operations are in the hands of a new generation, receptive to modern forms of management that are compatible with the overall vision of this volunteer-based peoples’ organisation.</p>

<p>The IFJ promotes international action to defend press freedom and social justice through strong, free and independent trade unions of journalists.</p>
<p>The IFJ does not subscribe to any given political viewpoint, but promotes human rights, democracy and pluralism. </p>
<p>The IFJ is opposed to discrimination of all kinds and condemns the use of media as propaganda or to promote intolerance and conflict. </p>
<p>The IFJ believes in freedom of political and cultural expression and defends trade union and other basic human rights. The IFJ is the organisation that speaks for journalists within the United Nations system and within the international trade union movement. </p>

The IFJ supports journalists and their unions whenever they are fighting for their industrial and professional rights and has established an International Safety Fund to provide humanitarian aid for journalists in need. 

IFJ policy is decided by the Congress which meets every three years and work is carried out by the Secretariat based in Brussels under the direction of an elected Executive Committee.
